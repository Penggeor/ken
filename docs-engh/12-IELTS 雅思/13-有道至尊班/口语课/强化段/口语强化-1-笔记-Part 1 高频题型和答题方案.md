#### 1. 经典答法——RED

- R（Response）：正面回答问题
- E（Explain）：具体解释说明
- D（Detail）：提供例子细节

```
Q: Do you like buying shoes?
A: Yeah, I love buying shoes.
And I'll probably buy a pair of shoes at least once a month, but sometimes more.
You can get them quite cheaply on apps like Taobao, so I won't ever spend a lot of money: maybe 100, 200 on a pair of shoes. I just like to have different shoes to go with my different clothes.
```



#### 2. 左右逻辑——RED 的变型

列举：

- R 正面回答问题
- E+ D：分点列举

```
Q: Is there good scenery in cities?

A: Sure.

First of all, there are parks and gardens, which have lovely scenery.

Also, some cityscapes can offer spectacular views. For example, the City Wall in Xi'an looks amazing in the evening when it's all lit up.
```

> 不要过多使用，有些面试官不太喜欢太多列举的回答。

转折：抑扬结合（其中整体否定+例外情况的结构比较好用）

- R：整体态度 - 部分否定
- E + D：转折 - 例外
- R：重复态度

```
Q: Do you like looking at yourself in the mirror?
A: Not really.
I'll only check myself in the mirror before I go out. That's just to make sure that my hair looks right and there's nothing on my face.
But I don't go and look in the mirror all the time just because I wanna see myself.
```



### 2. 开放式问题（W/H questions）

#### 1. 经典答法——RED

#### 2. 左右逻辑——RED 的变型

列举：

- R：引子 - 有很多
- E：最……的
- D：还有一个

```
Q: What kinds of public transport do they have in your country?
A: Most kinds, I'd say.
Every major metropolitan area has an underground railway now. You can find buses everywhere. Shared bicycles are common features in urban areas too. And taxis can be ordered online. That's not to mention cross-country transport like high-speed rail and airplanes.
```

分情况

- R：引子 - 不一定
- E + D：
  - 情况 1 + 结果
  - 情况 2 + 结果

```
Q: Who do you like to watch sports games with?
A: It depends(really),
If it's basketball, I'll watch it with my friends, cos we're all basket fans.
But if it's an international sports event and China are playing, like the Olympics or something, then I can watch that at home with my family.
```



### 3. 选择式问题

注意：出题率比较低，但是考到的时候需要注意，不要和封闭式、开放式问题混淆

#### 1. 经典答法——RED

#### 2. 左右逻辑——RED 的变型

转折：

- R：过去观点
- E：现在观点
- D：现在的理由

```
Q: Do you prefer a long break or several short breaks?
A: I used to prefer one longer break because I could have a better rest.
But now I think I'd rather have lots of short breaks rather than one long break, because I find if I have one long break, it's hard to get brack to work afterwards.
