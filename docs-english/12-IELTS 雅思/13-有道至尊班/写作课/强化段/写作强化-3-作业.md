Nowadays, the view about kid's age to begin education should be in the six or seven is take by someone, whereas another folk suggest get eudction more early is better. Both views will be analysied and my personal opinion will be provided.

Children's body is not yet ripe to accept eduction. Their abilities to recognize things isn't developed well, such as speaking difficultly, walking unstablely. It is unsuitable to start school at very younger because of unripen figure.

Furthermore, having amount of time to entertain can shape brain which help children absorbing knowledge  more quick and easy. No school, no assignment, children can totally relax to explore the world and company with family. For example, roaming in the mysterial forest with father and muther, running in the park hanging friend. Without regular school schedule, owning free to recreate make they more happy and satisfy.

Admittly, starting get teach in advance could completed eduction early, whereas the unsufficient grown can adopt itself to the social? 

In conclusion, access to the school in appropriate age is more beneficial considering thier body and entertainment time.
