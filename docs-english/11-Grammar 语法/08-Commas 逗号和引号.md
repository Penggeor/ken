引号的三个作用：
1. Contractions 缩略词：I will = I'll, He is = He's, She would = She'd, will not = won't
2. Possession 所有格：the cat's tail
3. Plurals 复数：i's and t's（表示字母的复数）

Plural Possession 复数所有格的写法：
- the dog's bone（单数）
- five dogs' bones（复数）

> 这里的引号只和 dog 有关，不和 park 有关，这一句是说“多条狗狗喜欢的公园”
- The Harpers' house（复数）
- men's, women's, mice's, children's
> 不规则名词仍然使用's
